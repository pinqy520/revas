# Revas Usage Examples

This document serves as a placeholder and a collection point for various examples demonstrating how to use Revas components and features to build UIs. Over time, this section will be populated with practical code samples showcasing common patterns and solutions.

<!-- AI-IMPORTANCE:level=normal -->

The Revas demo application found in [`../../src/develop/App.tsx`](../../src/develop/App.tsx:1) within the main repository serves as a comprehensive source of examples.

<!-- AI-CONTEXT-START:type=usage -->

## Planned Examples

The following are examples that would be beneficial to include here:

### 1. Basic Layouts

- **Holy Grail Layout:** Demonstrating header, footer, main content, and sidebars using Flexbox with `<View>` components.
- **Card Layout:** Creating reusable card components with images, text, and touchable actions.
- **Grid System:** Implementing a simple grid for aligning content.

### 2. Component Showcases

- **`<ScrollView>` with Dynamic Content:** Example of a `<ScrollView>` whose content size changes.
- **`<ListView>` with Variable Height Items:** A more detailed example of using `<ListView>` when `itemHeight` is a function.
- **Advanced `<Image>` Usage:** Demonstrating `onLoad`, `onError` handling, and perhaps placeholder content.
- **Custom `<Touchable>` Feedback:** Using `onPressIn` and `onPressOut` with `Animated` API for custom button animations beyond `activeOpacity`.

### 3. Animations

- **Sequential Animations:** Chaining multiple `Animated.timing()` calls.
- **Parallel Animations:** Running multiple animations simultaneously.
- **Gesture-Driven Animations:** Linking `Animated.Value.setValue()` to touch move events for draggable elements.
- **Looping Animations.**

### 4. Styling Techniques

- **Complex Gradients:** Using multiple color stops and `locations` with `<LinearGradient>`.
- **Overlapping Elements with `zIndex`:** Clear examples of how `zIndex` (if directly supported as a style or managed via draw order) affects rendering.
- **Text Styling Showcase:** Demonstrating various font styles, weights, alignments, and text shadow effects.

### 5. Event Handling

- **Nested Touchables:** How touch events propagate with nested `<Touchable>` components.
- **Simple Drag Gesture:** Implementing a basic draggable `<View>`.

### 6. Performance

- **Caching Strategies:** Examples of when and how to use `cache: true` and `forceCache: true` effectively.
- **Optimizing Large Lists:** Best practices for `<ListView>` data and `renderItem` functions.
