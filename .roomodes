      "customInstructions": "After entering Test Mode for Revas:\n\n1. **Understand Requirements & Documentation:** Review component/feature documentation (e.g., `docs/modules/components/`, `docs/modules/core/`) and any existing test plans or bug reports.\n2. **Create Test Plan:** Develop a comprehensive test plan covering:\n    - Visual rendering accuracy (styles, layout, text, images, gradients).\n    - Interaction logic (touch events, gestures, `onPress`, scrolling, `pointerEvents`).\n    - Edge cases and different prop combinations.\n    - Performance considerations (e.g., for `<ListView>`, caching).\n    - Accessibility (if applicable, though canvas accessibility is limited).\n3. **Prepare Test Environment & Resources:** Set up test pages or scenarios. For E2E tests, prepare Playwright MCP interactions.\n4. **Execute Tests:** \n    - Perform manual checks if necessary.\n    - Automate canvas interactions and assertions using Playwright MCP (e.g., `browser_click` at coordinates, `browser_take_screenshot` for visual diffing).\n    - Verify event callbacks are triggered correctly.\n5. **Analyze Results & Document Issues:** If tests fail, document clear, reproducible steps, expected vs. actual results, and relevant screenshots or console logs. Reference specific documentation for expected behavior.\n6. **Propose Solutions (Optional):** Based on understanding, suggest potential areas in the code or architecture that might be causing the issue.\n7. **Iterate or Conclude:** If issues are found, switch to Code Mode with the bug report. If all tests pass, switch to Summary Mode to document test outcomes.",

Review relevant code in `src/revas/` and test reports.\n3. **Update/Create Documentation:** \n    - Modify existing documents or create new ones in `docs/` to accurately reflect the changes.\n    - Ensure all AI metadata tags (`ai_keywords`, `ai_contexts`, `ai_relations`) are correct and comprehensive.\n    - Apply AI content markers (`AI-IMPORTANCE`, `AI-CONTEXT-START/END`) appropriately.\n    - Verify technical accuracy of all statements, API descriptions, and code examples.\n4. **Ensure Consistency:** Maintain consistency in terminology, style, and structure across the entire documentation library.\n5. **Update Key Navigational & Maintenance Files:**\n    - Update `docs/ai-index/navigation-guide.md` if new documents affect navigation paths.\n    - Update `docs/maintenance/changelog.md` with a clear entry for the changes.\n    - If high-level architecture changed, review and update `docs/ai-index/overview.md` and `docs/architecture/system-overview.md`.\n6.  **Validate Quality (Self-Review):** Use the checklist in `docs/ai-index/documentation-guide.md` to perform a thorough self-review of all modified/created documentation.\n7.  **Ensure Completeness:** Confirm that all relevant aspects of the changes are documented and that there are no obvious omissions. If significant gaps are found, propose creating new documentation tasks.",
